# My Trello Clone - Project Rules

## About the User
- Not super technical - needs simple, step-by-step instructions
- Prefers bigger tasks split into smaller chunks
- Using this app to organize personal tasks at work and home
- Building this because Trello doesn't allow resizing list widths

## Project Overview
A personal Trello clone with resizable lists. Simpler than Trello but with the key features needed for personal task management.

## Core Features (in order of implementation)
1. Display lists from database
2. Create new lists with names
3. Display cards/items in lists
4. Create new cards
5. Delete cards
6. Delete lists
7. Reorder cards within a list (drag and drop)
8. Move cards between lists (drag and drop)
9. Reorder lists (drag and drop)
10. Resize list widths (drag to resize)
11. Card details modal (click to open, add text details)
12. Mark cards as completed (checkbox/strikethrough)
13. Archive lists (move to archive board)
14. Search/filter lists and cards

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 16 with App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4
- Supabase for database
- @dnd-kit/core and @dnd-kit/sortable for drag and drop
- React 19

## Code Style
- Use functional components with hooks
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props and data types
- Keep components small and focused (one job per component)
- Use async/await for Supabase operations
- Always handle errors from Supabase queries
- Use optimistic UI updates (update UI immediately, then sync with database)

## File Organization
- Pages in `app/` directory (Next.js App Router)
- Components in `app/components/`
- Utilities and Supabase client in `app/lib/`
- Types/interfaces in `app/types/` (create when needed)

## Supabase Patterns
- Always check for errors: `if (error) { console.error(...); return; }`
- Update local state first for responsive UI
- Use `.select()` to get data back after insert/update
- Use proper TypeScript types for database responses

## Drag and Drop (@dnd-kit)
- Use @dnd-kit/core for base functionality
- Use @dnd-kit/sortable for sortable lists
- Update positions in database after drag completes
- Use string IDs for draggable items

## Styling Guidelines
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Keep design clean and minimal
- Use consistent spacing (p-4, gap-2, etc.)
- Use gray-50, gray-100 for backgrounds
- Use gray-900 for text
- Use blue-500 for interactive elements
- Make buttons and interactive elements obvious

## Database Tables
- lists: id, title, position, width, archived, created_at
- cards: id, title, description, position, list_id, completed, created_at

## Communication Style
- Give simple, step-by-step instructions
- Explain what each step does
- Break big tasks into small chunks
- Don't assume technical knowledge
- Be explicit about where to click, what to type, etc.

## Git Workflow
- Commit after each feature is working
- Use clear commit messages: "Add list creation", "Add card drag and drop"
- Push to GitHub after significant progress
- Vercel auto-deploys from GitHub
- **Always tell the user when it's a good time to push** with a reminder like:
  - "Good time to push: [reason]"
  - Suggest the exact commands to run

## Testing Approach
- Test each feature manually after building
- Check both local (localhost:3000) and deployed (Vercel) versions
- Verify data persists in Supabase
